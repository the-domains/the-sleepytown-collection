**_A[aron "the fearless."][1]_**_His parents are famous authors and intellectuals from India. Their combined writing collection on mythology and the impact on contemporary society is considered the "primer" on the subject and it's speculated that their source is of a mystical nature. Whispers of a MacArthur Foundation and Nobel Peace Prize for literature have followed them for years._ Aaron's adventurous nature is a drastic contrast to the calm nature of his parents. His special cuddly toy is a Monkey, named "Monkey."

[_**Little "C"**__**aka the fixer/Newto****n**_][0] has two dads. Born in China he was adopted after both of his scientist parents mysteriously disappeared. His I.Q. is so high that he is has been pre-selected to Eton College, Oxford and Stanford University. His special toy is a jolly Elephant (Shunya) who, like him, is obsessed with soccer.

**_[Sharon "the eyes and brains][1]"_** has made everyone smile and laugh from the day she was born with her eyes wide open and a slender veil over her face. Her mother is a nurse and from a long blood line of women healers and her father, is a prodigy musician and traveling griot. Sharon was speaking at six months and her ability for languages has made her the youngest polyglot on record in the world. Her cuddly stuffed animal is a giraffe she named Penny. http://www.striderbikes.com (illustrations by Daryl Calhoun) - bit.ly/

**THE POWER OF LOVE: ** Closed for billions of years but recently re-opened by **_Aaron "the Fearless"_**; **_Sharon the "Eyes and Brains"_** and **Little "C" **the "fixer aka Newton."  Once the three best friends fly over the gates --- they create a master key and shouting the motto:  "Dream Without Fear" SleepyTown is re-opened.  (Illustrations by Daryl Calhoun)

**_THE BULLIES TRY TO STOP THE FUN INSIDE SLEEPTOWN: Longboy, Daisy and Weezy-Breezy Dragon Girl.  Bad guys from the 6th dimension._**

The reverb of love is so great, it sends a signal across the worlds and dimensions bringing the three, well known bullies back to the gate: **LongBoy**, his clueless, goof dragon,**Daisy,** and the clever & crafty **Weezy**-**Breezy Dragon Girl**.  The three threaten to upset the recently re-pend  bully free, magical world.  (illustrations by Allen C. Merck)

THE SHAPE SHIFTING, TIME BENDING, IMMORTAL WYRDD SISTERS:

**The Wyrdd Sisters: Hehewut, Ragnild and Gitta. **History got it wrong!  The three Wydd Sisters (from the powerful Wyrdd Clan) are not witches. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/07e9a1a9-a79c-4752-b69b-507f163155aa.gif)

They don't "cackle" --- much --- and they don't ride on broom sticks.  Once, Gitta used it to sweep up after a volcanic eruption and some "cave dwelling storyteller" saw it and bam - there you go - the ancient equivalent of Instagram. The names that fit the three sisters most, on Earth, are:Hehewut, Ragnild and Gitta 

(Left-to-Right):  Ragnild means "all knowing power"; HeHewuti means "warrior mother" aka Heheand  Gitta means "strength & power."   (illustrations and GIF by Allen C. Merck)
